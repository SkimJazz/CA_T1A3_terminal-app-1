1,wolf,"I roam through the forest, with pack by my side,
My senses are sharp, and my instincts abide.
I'm a hunter at heart, and fiercely defend,
And I'll guide you through life, till the very end.
With loyalty unbroken, and strength as my guide,
I'll be there to protect you, through every stride."
2,eagle,"I soar through the sky, with strength and with grace,
My talons are sharp, and my eyes see the place.
I'm a hunter by nature, with instincts so true,
And I'll guide you to greatness, with a spirit that's new.
My wingspan is wide, and my will is so strong,
And I'll show you the way, where you've never belonged."
3,penguin,"I waddle on land and glide through the sea,
With my tuxedo style, I'm as cute as can be.
I'm a master of diving, deep down I'll go,
With a belly full of blubber, to keep me aglow.
I'll huddle with others, and make quite a sound,
While raising my young, on the cold ice ground."
